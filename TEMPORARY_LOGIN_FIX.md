# Temporary Login Fix for Vercel Deployment

## The Problem:
The security update generates a random password that's only shown in the console, which you can't access on Vercel.

## Quick Solution:

Since the database is stored in your browser's localStorage, you need to:

### Option 1: Clear Browser Data (Easiest)
1. Open your Vercel deployment URL
2. Open Browser DevTools (F12)
3. Go to **Application** → **Local Storage** → Your site URL
4. Delete the entry `metalsheets_database`
5. Refresh the page
6. The system will create a new database with a default password

### Option 2: Use These Temporary Credentials

For now, I'll modify the code to use a known default password for initial setup.

**Temporary Default Credentials:**
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `Admin@2024`
